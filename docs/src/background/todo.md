# Planned features

The following features are planned for future releases:

- Prepared geometry to speed up repeated GDAL operations.
- Spatial indice support to speed up spatial queries (see also [GeoAcceleratedArrays.jl](https://github.com/evetion/GeoAcceleratedArrays.jl))
- Spatial joins (see also [GeometryOps.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeo/GeometryOps.jl))
- Wrapper types around DataFrame and geometry columns for easier plotting and dispatch.
