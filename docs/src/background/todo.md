# TODO
- [ ] Prepared geometry, spatial indices (LibGEOS) (probably can't be done as GDAL OGR is not directly compatible)
- [x] IGeometry should be IGeometry{WKBType} for easy Schema detection, fix upstream
- [ ] Empty geom column name fix should be moved upstream
- [ ] More drivers selected on extension
- [x] CRS stored in metadata
- [x] Work on Geointerface integration
- [ ] Work on spatial joins/filters
- [x] Override showing of WKT geometry on print for performance
