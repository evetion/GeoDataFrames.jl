# Inspiration

This package has been inspired by [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/), the Python package that makes working with geospatial data formats easy.
In Julia, while the same functionality is supported by ArchGDAL, reading and writing geospatial vector data is not straightforward and many questions were raised. This package wraps the required ArchGDAL operations into several oneliners.

Also see the package announcement at the [Julia discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-announcing-geodataframes-jl/56735).
